# Zebra Finch Auditory Memory: Behavior, Lesions, and Ephys

## Data

Summary of behavioral data is located in [BehavioralDataSummary.md](BehavioralDataSummary.md).

### Data File Summary

an asterisk indicates file that hasn't been added yet

| Filename     |Description|
|--------------|---|
|Subjects.csv  | A list of subjects, subject sex, and experimental group assignment (NCM/HVC/CTRL) |
|ExperimentDates.csv | Lists the date ranges that each subject underwent each stage of the experiment |
|Vocalizers.csv* | A table of vocalizer name and sex |
|Stimuli.csv* | Stimulus file metadata for the stimuli contained in stimuli.tar.gz |
|stimuli.tar.gz* | A folder `stimuli/` containing all the stimulus WAV files, referenced by Stimuli.csv |
|InjectionProtocols.csv* | Describes the various injection protocols used, including lesioning agents, amounts, and coordinates |
|SubjectInjections.csv* | Describes which subjects underwent which injection protcols in InjectionProtocols.csv |
|LesionQuantificationSummary.csv | Table with lesion volume in four quadrants in each hemisphere for NCM lesioned subjects |
|LesionQuantification/SUBJECT_NAME.csv | A separate table with the human-annotated lesion size data in saggital slices |
|subject_songs.tar.gz* | A folder `subject_songs/` that contains recordings of some male subjects' songs before and after lesion |
|TrialData.csv | The main data table with information about every trial for every subject during all the experimental runs |

Data directory should be placed in the top level of this project (i.e. `zebra-finch-memory-lesions/data`). Some data files must be generated by code in the `scripts/` directory.

## Code

This project implements functions for loading behavioral and lesion data for our auditory memory project, as well as code for data analysis.

### Run tests

```shell
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Dependencies

Code is run and tested on Python3.9, using requirements listed in requirements.txt (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

### Jupyter Lab

Running the notebooks with Jupyter lab requires a couple extensions. To have interactive plots,

ipympl is required along with the jupyter-matplotlib jupyter extension.

It is possible that the jupyterlab-manager extension is also needed, as well as npm and nodejs (>=10.0)

# Zebra Finch Auditory Memory: Behavior, Lesions, and Ephys

## Data

Summary of behavioral data is located in [BehavioralDataSummary.md](BehavioralDataSummary.md).

### Data File Summary

an asterisk indicates file that hasn't been added yet

```shell
data/
  behavior/
    *Subjects.csv
    *ExperimentDates.csv
    *Vocalizers.csv
    TrialData.csv
    *Stimuli.csv
    *stimuli.zip       # TODO: replace with tar.gz?
    *InjectionProtocols.csv
    *SubjectInjections.csv
    *LesionQuantification.csv

```

Data directory should be placed in the top level of this project (i.e. `zebra-finch-memory-lesions/data`) and can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M76aCU6dXOHVGbm1duyboV_wILjh0Ovq?usp=sharing). 

Some data files must be generated by code in the `scripts/` directory.

## Code

This project implements functions for loading behavioral and lesion data for our auditory memory project, as well as code for data analysis.

### Run tests

```shell
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Dependencies

Code is run and tested on Python3.9, using requirements listed in requirements.txt (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

### Jupyter Lab

Running the notebooks with Jupyter lab requires a couple extensions. To have interactive plots,

ipympl is required along with the jupyter-matplotlib jupyter extension.

It is possible that the jupyterlab-manager extension is also needed, as well as npm and nodejs (>=10.0)

# Zebra Finch Auditory Memory: Behavior, Lesions, and Ephys

## Data

Summaries of behavioral data and ephys data are located in [BehavioralDataSummary.md](BehavioralDataSummary.md) and [EphysDataSummary.md]( EphysDataSummary.md).

### Data File Summary

```shell
data/
  behavior/
    LesionData.csv    # <-- Included
    TrialData.csv     # <-- Included
    stimuli.zip       # <-- Included
  ephys/
    UnitData.pkl              # <-- Included
    StimData.pkl              # <-- Included
    UnitRenditionData.pkl     # <-- scripts/create_renditions_dataframe.py
    AuditoryUnitTable.pkl     # <-- scripts/calculate_auditory_units.py
    UnitCoherences.pkl        # <-- scripts/compute_coherences.py
    RenditionCoherences.pkl   # <-- scripts/compute_coherences.py
    stimuli/                  # <-- Included
    unit_waveforms/           # <-- Not Included
```

Data directory should be placed in the top level of this project (i.e. `zebra-finch-memory-lesions/data`) and can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M76aCU6dXOHVGbm1duyboV_wILjh0Ovq?usp=sharing). Last count shows it as 356MB zipped. I excluded 20GB of unit waveforms data which would be located in `data/ephys/unit_waveforms`, so the function `load_data.load_unit_waveforms(unit_id)` will not be usable.

Some data files must be generated by code in the `scripts/` directory.

## Code

This project implements functions for loading behavioral, lesion, and ephys data for our auditory memory project, as well as code for data analysis.

### Run tests

```shell
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Dependencies

Code is run and tested on Python3.6, using requirements listed in requirements.txt (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`). --A local installation of R is required for statistical functions and installation of `rpy2` library (this is no longer needed).--

### Jupyter Lab

Running the notebooks with Jupyter lab requires a couple extensions. To have interactive plots,

ipympl is required along with the jupyter-matplotlib jupyter extension.

It is possible that the jupyterlab-manager extension is also needed, as well as npm and nodejs (>=10.0)
